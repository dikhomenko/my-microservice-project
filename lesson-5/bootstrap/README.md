# Terraform Bootstrap Project

This project creates the foundational infrastructure needed for Terraform remote state management:

- S3 bucket for storing Terraform state files
- DynamoDB table for state locking

## Important Notes

- This project uses **LOCAL STATE** (not remote backend)
- Run this **ONCE** before setting up other Terraform projects
